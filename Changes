Objects that talk domain:
-------------------------
Changed name of amount updation methods in Player.java
Separated reading and validating configurations

Objects that are loose and discrete
------------------------------------
Configuration made part of Game - Removed associated changes from Game Controller
   Game will be created by : first loading configuration, then players and then board and then dice.

Design patterns for win
------------------------------------
Made dice singleton pattern to avoid user from making objects of it

Others
------------------------------------
Though file name was passed to accessProperty, file name was hard coded in the method
Removed getConfiguration method - as the same purpose is served by getInstance method
Made loading of default configuration as default operation if user has provided invalid configurations
